# CIS 425 API Extra Credit Assignment
This is my source code for the CIS 425 API extra credit assignment. This pings two APIs: a REST API that simply returns the IP of the requester and a SOAP API that returns a list
of all countries sorted by name. Once the results are obtained from the APIs, they are displayed to the terminal.
